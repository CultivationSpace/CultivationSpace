- question: "When was Cultivation Space founded?"
  answer: "The Cultivation Space was originally founded in 2015 as Onion Space, a community space for the Tor Project, also known as Zwiebelfreunde e.V.. Over the years, various other communities and individuals used the space, which was not limited to Tor activities. Therefore, in early 2022, we changed our name to Cultivation Space."
- question: "Why ExRotaPrint in Wedding?"
  answer: "The premises of ExRotaprint have been our home from the beginning. Its structure and environment allow us to maintain our open door policy and fits perfectly with our values. You can easily reach ExRotaPrint by public transport (U9 Nauener Platz or S 41/42 & U6 Wedding)."
- question: "Can I become a member?"
  answer: "We do not currently offer memberships. If you want to join the Cultivation Space, contact us by email. This is an open space for sharing. That said, please familiarise yourself with our Code of Conduct, which applies in our space (both physical and virtual). People who rely on the space and have been vetted by the community will be given an RFID key to access the space."
- question: "Do you have drinks and snacks?"
  answer: "We make sure that the fridge and snack bar are filled and have a donation box for this. If you have any special requests, please talk to us so that we can take them into account for the next order. There will of course be coffee and tea."
- question: "What amenities does the space provide?"
  answer: "Up to 18 people can work in the workroom. We also have two meeting rooms with TV and video conferencing and podcast equipment, a projector and a screen. Two soundproofed and ventilated telephone booths (one for one person and one for 2-4 people) provide an additional environment for telephone and video calls. Our kitchen is equipped with a microwave, refrigerator, dishwasher and a not-so-fancy coffee maker. The unisex bathroom also offers a shower."
- question: "How much does it cost?"
  answer: "It's up to you. The Cultivation Space is financed exclusively by donations and grants. We need less money than other coworking spaces because we don't make a profit. If you appreciate the workspace, you should donate so we can keep paying the rent. If you are not sure how much you can donate, please contact us."
- question: "I want to organize an event at the space, how does it work?"
  answer: "Please contact us via space@techcultivation.org and let us know the details of the event and if and how much you can donate to cover the cost of the room. We can then arrange a date."
